# Stock-Price-Prediction
The Stock Price Prediction project leverages deep learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Using a time-series approach, the model is built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically designed to handle sequential data. The goal of the project is to provide an accurate forecast of stock trends, assisting investors in making informed decisions. The project utilizes the open-source TensorFlow library, which simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating neural networks.

## Tech Stack:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks:
1/ TensorFlow: Used for building and training the deep learning model (RNN).
2/ Pandas: For loading and manipulating the stock price dataset.
3 NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array handling.
4/ Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
-  Data: Historical stock prices (can be fetched from online repositories like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).
- Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for time series prediction.
 - Environment: Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation.

## Conclusion: 

The Stock Price Prediction project showcases the power of deep learning in time series forecasting. By using an RNN with LSTM layers, the model is capable of learning and predicting complex stock market patterns, resulting in more accurate predictions over time. This project not only highlights TensorFlow's capabilities in deep learning but also demonstrates the practical application of neural networks in financial data analysis. Future improvements could include integrating additional features like market sentiment analysis or real-time data for even more refined predictions.
